# Griffin Analytics Environment

## Purpose
Griffin is an analytics environment specifically designed for marketing data science and machine learning. It provides an integrated development environment (IDE) for data scientists and analysts working with marketing data.

## Problems It Solves
- Provides a specialized environment for marketing analytics
- Integrates data science and machine learning tools for marketing applications
- Offers a unified interface for marketing data analysis

## How It Should Work
Griffin operates as an IDE with specialized kernels and language server support. It's designed to be run in a Python virtual environment with specific dependencies installed. The application is launched through shell scripts that handle environment setup and activation.

The core functionality appears to be built around Python-based data science tools, with custom kernels (griffin_kernels) and language server extensions (pyls-griffin) to enhance the IDE capabilities for marketing analytics.
